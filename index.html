            <h3>What is it?</h3>
            <p>
                Web 4.0 is giving data back to the people, without any requirements of crypto. With Web 4.0, you have a singular profile
                that can exist across the entire web - never making another profile ever again, just connecting your existing one to 
                another website.

            <h3>How does this give me my data back</h3>
            <p>
                You get to not only choose where your profile is stored and backed up to, but also can completely erradicate your
                internet existance in practically 1 button. With supporting websites, they will store any data they or you create,
                on said server. Any that choose to host the data themselves, will be upheald to an open source data protection standard,
                and failing to upkeep it will result in public shaming via black-lists. Search engines will state the website does
                not properly protect your data to specific standards & will give warnings ahead of time if there are worse issues. 
                Search engine <i>should</i> give the option to automatically block all "unsafe" from popping up.

            <h3>Ok, but HOW?</h3>
            <p>
                By compartmentalizing common sections of the internet into open server software, anyone can spin up a server to host
                their own data, if they do not want to use another business' services. At the current moment of conception, there are
                just a few compartmentalizations that can be had.

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Scammers using fake names, potentially stopped by PUIN</li>
                    <li>Scammers trying to get you to backup you profile to their server, potentially only stoppable education (Just like email scams)</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Profiles</h3>
            <p>
                Profiles are an internet identification server, either hosting your main profile or backup profile. Backup profiles
                are clones of the main profile, in case the main profile server goes down. Profiles need to at the least host a publically
                accessible username, a basic list of just servers/websites connected to user, and a PUIN (Public Username Idendification 
                Number) associated with that username. Hidden from the public, the server needs to hold more identifiable information of
                how it connects to said servers/websites (Such as a private key or such), a private PUIN key unique to your PUID, the ability
                of multiple authentication methods (auth app, email, and any extras they can afford), and a list of communication specific
                connections (used for web4.0 communications). This is the only server type required for using Web4.0, and can be mixed with
                other server types to help reduce web clutter.
                <hr>
                PUIN (Public Username Identification Number) allows a user to publically reserve their name internet wide. One is not required
                to get one, and can take the username used by another - but it will be marked as not being PUIN registered & potentially
                not who they say they are (Potentially anti-scammer technique).
                <hr>
                For the first 5 years of Web4.0, it should be <i>discouraged</i> for people to sell names off - to reduce mass username
                creation spamming, so that everyone at the time has a chance to have the name they want.

            <h3>Digital Ownership Servers</h3>
            <p>
                DOServers act as a method of containing a database of digital product ownership. These would contain things like digital games,
                music, software, and even videos/images that have been posted to websites. Servers are free to send assets to DOs'and can 
                decide to require multi-factor authentication to recieve; but sending digital items must require multi-factor auth. DOs items
                do not need to store any more than just text, and websites should be encouraged to use DOs made by other services. For exmaple,
                purchasing a game from Microsoft will deposit a license ID & necessary info with it, and Steam can read from your DOs that game
                license, check that it is legitmate, and then make a stored reference in Steam servers so that you now have access to the game there.
                If an item is transfered from a DOs, a message is sent across all the connected servers/websites that it is no longer owner by
                said user.

            <h3>Communication Servers</h3>
            <p>
                Communication servers are simply, methods of communicating between people; limited to at the least, plain text. These should
                be considered a direct replacement to text messaging and cellular calling (No limits on text/calls, including regional distances).
                These servers can go as far as being Discord itself. It is highly suggested that the communication types become standardized in a 
                way that, one web service can directly text/call/facetime with other web services.
                <hr>
                <h4>What happens to cellular?</h4>
                <p>
                    Cellular shouldn't be removed from existance if these come about Cellular offers a publically accessible form of communication
                    to emergency services and backup services.

            <h3>Public Username Services</h3>
            <p>
                Public username services are divided into 2 parts. Frst is the public username servers (Essentially a DNS for usernames), which host
                a copy of every registered username where they came from, and location to main and backup profile. The second half is the Public 
                username registrars, of which can register new usernames, spreading them to PUS's for servers and websites to appropriately use.
                In order to be a PUR, they must pay annually a fee to at least 1 web 4.0 developer (a group dedicaed to making web 4.0 standards
                better) or further web 4.0 themselves with new technologies/services- and the company must prove to be a legitimate company & not
                a company dedicated to scamming users in one way or another (Such as submitting altered PUINs, where said registrar could then steal
                all user data directly from their profiles).
            </p>

            <h3>Data Storage</h3>
            <p>
                These are simply servers dedicated to storing data securely. Most likely to be a common part of Profile servers, web sites/servers
                will request access to the users data storage server, and if user approves, the website/server can then send a packet defining a
                database, and how often the website/server will access this data (so server can then appropriately put database on fast or slow
                access). Then the website can freely alter JUST that database in any way - UNLESS the user decides to revoke said websites access
                to the database. Websites/services are not required to use these servers for your data, but will be shown on website somehow in 
                a very noticable way, that it will privately store your data. All access to the private database will be appropriately recorded,
                so that users can notice whether or not said website/service is accessing data innapropriately (such as gathering a copy of it all
                at a later time, to sell or abuse). It is not a perfect system, but is designed to push websites to not use their own servers for 
                protecting data, in favor of open source server technology that is updated and constantly improved upon by the entire world.

            <h3>Cloud Storage</h3>
            <p>
                Users can optionally opt in for websites to use their own cloud storage server, for content including images, videos, audio, etc.
                This will allows users to freely shut down their content whenever they want, and even cross-post content across websites from a 
                single server linkage instead of uploading to multiple servers. This is an entirely optional server to use, and shouldnt be pushed
                too much on users.
